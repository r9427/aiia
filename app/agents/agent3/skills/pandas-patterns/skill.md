## Data loading
Use `pd.read_csv()` for CSV files. Always check `df.info()` and `df.describe()` first.

## Visualization
Use `matplotlib` for bar charts, `seaborn` for statistical plots.
Save figures with `plt.savefig("output.png", dpi=150, bbox_inches="tight")` to the working directory.

## Reporting
Write a markdown summary to `report.md`.

## Saving outputs
Save `report.md` along with any generated charts.
